# Chord-Finder

Simple Excel guitar chord finder, with an emphasis on alternative tunings. Select a tuning and a chord, and the macro will highlight the notes that make up the chord. It is intended to be useful when playing in a unfamiliar tuning, where you have worked out some chords by ear but can't find a specific chord (e.g. the V chord in whatever key you are using) and don't want to draw a fretboard and work it out. 

The data (tunings, chords, and so on) are stored on a hidden sheet and can be edited if the worksheet protection is removed; the sheet protection password is 'pwd'. This makes it possible to add tunings and chords.
